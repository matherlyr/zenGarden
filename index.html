    Hey! Zen Garden!

  <h1> WHAT?? ZEN GARDEN!! Cool.. </h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Zen Garden is an interesting website beacuse you can view the same website in many different visual formats. <br>
      This is done by editing the CSS of the webpage so that the information can be presented in a way that makes sense <br>
      Zen Garden encourages users to create their own version of the website in order to display all the wonderful things <br>
      that you can do with CSS.

    <li>
      One of the CSS formats I really like is called "A Robot Named Jimmy." Jimmy is always smiling, and it makes for a happy visit <br>
      to the site each time I visit. One of the features that I like on Jimmy's website is the fact that it has a liquid layout, <br>
      meaning that no matter the size of the screen, you can always see Jimmy's happy face and the content he wants to share. <br>
